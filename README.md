Since .NET MAUI doesn‚Äôt natively support null values in DatePickers, this control fills that gap by including a ‚Äúclear‚Äù button that lets users reset the field.

It also supports a visual placeholder, customizable display, and optional minimum and maximum date bounds.

By implementing this control natively instead of using a NuGet package, you maintain full control over its customization and evolution, from updating styles to adding new bindable properties as needed.
