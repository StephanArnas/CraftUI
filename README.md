This article introduces a custom CfMultiPickerPopup control in .NET MAUI to support multi-selection in a clean and reusable way.

It explains key design decisions like splitting single and multi-selection logic for maintainability and implementing a custom SelectionList to sync UI and ViewModel.

By the end, youâ€™ll have a fully functional multi-picker component that fills the gap left by the lack of native support in MAUI.
